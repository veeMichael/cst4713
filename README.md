# CST 4713 Class - 	Dynamic Web Dev: Servlet/JSP

This repository showcases my coursework completed during the CST 4713 class where I was tasked with fixing, adding, and making code work using (mostly) Java and JSPs, as well as utilizing Spring Boot. My final project involved presenting all of my work on a web page with functional links and a representation of data on a webpage provided to me. Although the project functions correctly within the WAR file, it no longer operates properly outside of it. This repository is a demonstration of my technical skills and I hope to showcase it to potential employers as I pursue my first internship opportunity.

Here is the download to the WAR file to run the application if interested:

To run the WAR file, follow these steps:

Download the file.
Open the Command Prompt (CMD) in the folder where the file is located.
Type java -jar Vanunu-webproject.war in the CMD and press enter to run the file.
To view the output, go to localhost:8080 in your web browser.
